# CO452 Programming Concepts
Programming Concepts introduces principles that are common to all programming languages. 
The module develops knowledge of essential programming structures (e.g. the use of variables, 
conditional logic, repeating and branching statements, functions, arrays, algorithms and object 
based structures) and of critical thinking skills. 

Students are introduced to object-oriented concepts in an educational environments that visualises 
the programming process and then progress to apply those concepts in professional coding environments 
used in the workplace. On successful completion participants will be able to: 
- Interpret, implement, test and document robust program solutions;. 
- Undertake further study in advanced application and Web programming techniques using industry-standard frameworks and object-oriented libraries.
